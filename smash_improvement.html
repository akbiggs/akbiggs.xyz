<h1>Improving at Smash</h1>

<p>A collection of mindset changes where I noticed my competitive Smash gameplay improve significantly. These tips apply to all games in the series.</p>

<p><b>Summary:</b></p>
<ol>
        <li>Don't stop after attacking.</li>
        <li>Don't forget to practice movement sometimes.</li>
        <li>Engage from good positions and disengage from bad positions.</li>
        <li>

<h2>1. Following through after attacking</h2>

I used to stop in place after attacking because I was surprised that I hit or missed the opponent. This meant:

<ol>
        <li>Combos were more difficult. I needed to follow my opponent after landing the attack and keep the string going.</li>
        <li>I got punished more often after missing. Throwing out a quick hitbox after missing helped to stuff my opponent's movement towards me, and retreating quickly helped me avoid shallow attacks, opening up more opportunities to punish.</li>
</ol>

<h2>2. Practicing movement occasionally</h2>

<p>The movement practice routine I've settled on:</p>

<ol>
        <li>Go on Battlefield in Training Mode.</li>
        <li>Move around while looking at the opponent instead of my own character.</li>
        <li>Anticipate where my character is without checking.</li>
        <li>Attack occasionally to verify my position and understand the range and lag of my attacks. Don't do this often, or I'll build bad Training Mode habits.</li>
        <li>Shadowbox with the opponent. Think about what their movement and attacks look like and attack / defend yourself accordingly.</li>
        <li>Repeat until these actions feel natural. This will take more time at the start, then it becomes second nature and you don't have to practice often. Nowadays I usually warm this up between stocks during tournament matches.</li>
 </ol>

<p>Better movement lets you attack and retreat more quickly, opening up punishes and baits that weren't previously available.</p>

<h2>3. Extending attacks</h2>

<p>I used to attack where my opponent was currently standing. In practice, when your opponent is playing defensively, you have to attack significantly farther to reach them. Anticipate your opponent's retreat and keep running past the point that feels natural to attack.</p>

<h2>4. Recognizing good positions and bad positions</h2>

<p>Examples of good positions for most matchups:</p>

<ul>
        <li>Being below the opponent. Most characters have good up-airs that can juggle opponents.</li>
        <li>On stage while your opponent is recovering. Opens up edgeguards.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had to consciously slow my game down and actively think about:</p>

<ol>
        <li>Who is in a good position right now?</li>
        <li>Who is in a bad position right now?</li>
</ol>

<p>Once I started to recognize this, I had to push myself to become comfortable launching attacks the moment I entered into a good position. I also have to consciously avoid attacking when I enter into a bad position and focus on moving out of the position instead.</p>

<h2>5. Baiting panic options</h2>

<p>It took time, but eventually I realized there are three very common panic options that appear when opponents are in bad positions.</p>

<ol>
        <li>Double-jumping. An opponent without a jump is easier to juggle.</li>
        <li>Air-dodging. An air-dodge can be smashed.</li>
        <li>Coming down with an attack. This can usually be stuffed out or shield-grabbed.</li>
</ol>

<p>At lower levels, I could bait these out by moving towards my opponent or simply waiting in place. If I avoided over-committing and kept my options open, my opponent would bury themselves.</p>

<p>The panic option varies from opponent to opponent. When facing off against a new opponent, I have to observe their panic option carefully during the first few interactions to open up the best punish opportunities.</p>

<h2>6. Being patient</h2>

<p>This one is delicate. Playing patiently does not necessarily mean to avoid approaching or attacking. It's more about how heavily I committed to certain options with your attacks and movement.</p>

<p>The best guide to this is the "Offense, Defense, Patience" section of <a href="http://www.meleeitonme.com/sharpening-your-sword-tais-marth-guide/">Sharpening Your Sword</a>. The whole guide is fantastic but that section is most pertinent. Ignore the fact that it's specific to Melee Marth. Reading this guide changed my playstyle and competitive mindset completely. I saw immediate improvement in my gameplay.</p>
