<h1>Avoiding Stress</h1>

<p>I have decided to make a conscious effort to avoid getting stressed out. I say "conscious effort" because this doesn't come naturally to me, so I have to actively think about it.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons I want to avoid stress:</p>

<ol>
        <li>I'm turning 28 on Tuesday. I spent most of my 20s feeling absolutely miserable.</li>
        <li>I have seen no indication that the things I stressed over were worth it.</li>
        <li>I've hurt other people by taking my stress out on them.</li>
        <li>The productivity that stress brings me is wiped away by the burnout that follows months later. A consistent pace would be more effective.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have decided that it would be better to accomplish nothing if I can be happy and I can make others happy. I am very tired of my toxic ambition.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to recognize that I am very fortunate to be in a privileged position where I even have the option of avoiding stress in my life.</p>
